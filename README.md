## Record Linkage
implementation of recordlinkage
Many data mining and machine learning projects require information from various data sources to be integrated and linked before they can be used for further analysis. A crucial task of such data integration is to identify which records refer to the same real-world entities across databases when no common entity identifiers are available and when records can contain errors and variations. This process of record linkage therefore has to rely upon the attributes that are available in the databases to be linked. For databases that contain personal information, for example, of customers, taxpayers, or patients, these are commonly their names, addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth.
